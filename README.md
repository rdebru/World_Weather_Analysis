# **WeatherPy with Python APIs**
	
## **Overview of Cities Weather Analysis** 
* Generate a set of random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMapSchool performance.Retrieve the following information from the API call, 
	* Latitude and longitude, 
	* Maximum temperature
	* Percent humidity
	* Percent cloudiness
	* City Name
	* Country 
	* Wind speed
	* Current Weather description

* Use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.

* From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, we will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
 
 
### Purpose 
* Retrieve Weather Data
* Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
* Create a Travel Itinerary Map
